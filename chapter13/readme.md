This chapter contains the source code for deploying a VPC AWS Production Account using the same configuration as your Development Account. You will use CloudFormation to provision a VPC with six subnets - two public subnets and four private (two of which would be used for your backend application stack and two for your database)
Your CloudFormation template will also provision route tables, a NAT Gateway in 1 AZ and the security group configurations to immitate the same configuration you have manually defined in the AWS Development Account where you have now already deployed your Todo List Application.
This project task is designed to help you appreciate how quickly you can start to build your production workloads using AWS CloudFormation
We strongly recommend that after you complete the project task, you delete the CloudFormation stack to ensure you do not incur any unecessary charges.
